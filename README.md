# TestOut issues

Various issues I've found in the TestOut curriculum.  Feel free to submit PRs for anything I've missed.

## General:

- __*The main site (www.testout.com) doesn't force HTTPS, allowing a MITM attacker (e.g. fake coffee shop wifi) to easily change the "Login" button to point at a fake login.*__  Also the site allow some insecure ciphers, see https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=testout.com
- Many times, practice questions are repeated multiple times, usually only with very minor variation
  - Sometimes a question set has us do a lab as part of the set that we had done independently before
  - **The midterm is a direct subset of the practice midterm.**
- The transcripts for videos often have errors
  - e.g. "ls pci" should be "lspci", etc.
- The Certification Exam doesn't tell you which questions you missed and why.

On a lighter note, whoever implemented the "My Web Search" in IE deserves 1000 high-fives!  10/10 top-tier easter egg
