# TestOut Linux Pro issues

Various issues I've found in the TestOut Linux Pro curriculum.  Feel free to submit PRs for anything I've missed.

## Chapter 1:

- 1.1.1: Ctl+Alt+F(1-6) is preferred over Alt+F(1-6) as the latter won't work if you are in a GUI evironment while the former will always work.
